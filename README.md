# ActivityReminder
A quick script to make a toast notification pop up.
requires the win10toast module to be installed  -> pip install win10toast

Only has two functions. One with a self-contained 15 minute "timer", then just a function to make the toast pop.
Its nothing fancy. I use it in Windows task scheduler to remind me to at least stand up every 15 minutes and hopefully do something.
Might make it fancier later.
